# primo-explore-but-layout

##Facets to the left
Moves facets to the left. Taken from https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/css, also adds background color to facets and creates slight left padding.

##Citation first
Adjusts the bar with export options - citation first, hide redundant.

##Results count
Adds a little margin to results count so it won't interfere with page number.

##Hide
Anything that needs to be hidden:
* personalize results
