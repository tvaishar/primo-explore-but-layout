##Facets to the left
Moves facets to the left. Taken from https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/css, also adds background color to facets and creates slight left padding. Shrinking of facets pane
was adjusted too. It is wide enough on "standard width devices" to display whole terms (without ...).

##Citation first
Adjusts the bar with export options - citation first, hide redundant.

##Results count
Adds a little margin to results count so it won't interfere with page number.

##Hide
Anything that needs to be hidden:
* personalize results

##Footer
Adds footer structure (js + html + css). Footer.html has to be copied to the main html directory of the view.

##Before - After
Sometimes it is useful to actually have the content generated by css (namely by before and after selectors)
