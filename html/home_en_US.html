					<p>Because of the closure of all BUT libraries, we have undertaken following measures to mitigate negative effects on our users:</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Loans which were due from 11. 3. to 31. 3. were prolonged until 1.4.</li>
							<li>All the libraries were closed also in the library system, which means that all running fines should not be increasing during the aforementioned period.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We will react to the situation and eventually extend the measures further.</p>
